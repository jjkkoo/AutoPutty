Original intent was to be small and just auto-login to your sessions, but developed into a pretty decent way of handling PuTTY connections/sessions.  There are other connection managers for PuTTY that also use tabs and can auto log you in, but they didn't layout the way I wanted so I decided to write my own.  Enjoy. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJustin Whitmore (@jwhitmore) Original Author.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
